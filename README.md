# README

This repository is about creating the Echo Bot on Telegram.
The name of my bot is Repeater Bot.
The full script that is created by myself has my bot key in it.
Bot key is the key that identifies your bot when you first 'sign up' with telegram. That is essentially the id.

The script is written using Python language. The functions are those of telegram's. You can go to:
<br/> https://core.telegram.org/bots/api for more of the api. <br/>
For the different library and framework for the different languages, you can refer from this link:
